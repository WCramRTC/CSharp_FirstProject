# Creating your first DOTNET project

At the bottom of the screen you will find the terminal.

```
@YourAccountName -> /workspaces/CSharp_FirstProject (main) $
```

> This is your command line. You can use this to interact with your computer, run programs, and navigate your files. You type in commands and keywords to perform action.

1. Click on the terminal window. You should see a little square appear. You can now type on the keyboard.


```terminal
    dotnet new console --use-program-main
```
Example: `YourAccountName -> /workspaces/CSharp_FirstProject (main) $ dotnet new console --use-program-main`

2. Press **enter**.

***Result***
In the explorer to the right, you should see two new files appear.

* CSharp_FirstProject`.csproj`
* Program`.cs`

**CSharp_FirstProject`.csproj`** is file that contains a list of all the files required for our new C# project.  
**Program`.cs`** is our CSharp file. This file is where we will write our code. 

## Step 2 - Opening Your Project

There are 2 ways of opening our `Program.cs` file. 
    1. Click on the `Program.cs` file
    2. Type `Program.cs` into our terminal.

We're going to do the second.

1. Click on the terminal, and type

```
dir
```
